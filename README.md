# screen-spots
Save a set of screen locations to later click on or move to using talon voice.

Defines shortcuts for saving the current mouse coordinates to a specific number. You can then use another shortcut with the same number to either move the mouse cursor to the saved position, or click on the saved position and immediately return the cursor to its current position.

The intended use case is to save the position of buttons or other frequently used locations so that you can click on them or return to them more quickly and with less effort.
